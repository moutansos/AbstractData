# AbstractData
AbstractData is a C# library and scripting language built to move data from one place to another.

Project Status: Under Development

## What sort of data?
TODO: Excel Files

TODO: Access Databases  
TODO: SQL Server Databases  
TODO: PostgreSql Databases  
TODO: MariaDB Databases  
TODO: Oracle Databases  
TODO: SQLite Databases 
TODO: MongoDB ?  
TODO: JSON File ?  

## Build with Visual Studio
This solution has been built for Visual Studio Community 2015 and can be edited and built in that environment.

## Build without Visual Studio
Without visual studio, download nuget bianaries from nuget.org and add nuget to your PATH. Then dowload Visual Studio 2015 Build Tools. After it has been installed then run the build.cmd file.

## Library Usage
Currently unusable. As things come together there will be a way to include the library in projects from source and also from NuGet.

## CLI Installation
Same answer as above. When things are working there will be a way to run scripts from the command line and an installer to add the CLI to the path.
