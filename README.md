# AbstractData
AbstractData is a C# library and scripting language built to move data from one place to another.

Project Status: Under Development

## What sort of data?
TODO: Excel Files  
TODO: CSV Files  
TODO: SQL Server Databases  
TODO: PostgreSql Databases  
TODO: MariaDB Databases   
TODO: SQLite Databases  
TODO: MongoDB ?  
TODO: JSON File ?  

## Library Usage
Currently unusable. As things come together there will be a way to include the library in projects from source and also from NuGet.

## CLI Installation
Same answer as above. When things are working there will be a way to run scripts from the command line and an installer to add the CLI to the path.
